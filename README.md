## Alexi's Computational Scirpts

 These are some simple, indipendent scripts, written for practice, and enetertainment, mainly with numpy (python3), though some may be in Octave (or MATLAB).

 These problems are mainly inspired by simple problems in Physics.

 Currently the file contains:

- Random walk (two different implementations)

- Damped Oscillator

- Body in a gravitational field

- Lorentz Attractor
